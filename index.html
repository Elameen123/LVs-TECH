  <h1>Case Study And Project</h1>
  <p>In this case study we highlight how we successfully implemented our smart water metering system to optimize Ibeju-Lekki water management
    This community had issues trying to optimize their water usage daily, this has caused a lot of people in the community lack access to free water
    due to wastage. When our team of engineers came into the community to install the water meter system there were so delighted and thankful, some say that 
    we have brought a significant change into the community. However, this has helped them reduced their water consumption.
